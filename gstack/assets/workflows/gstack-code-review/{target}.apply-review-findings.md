Apply gstack code-review findings.

Use implementation target {{implementation_target}} for any code changes. Read
the review synthesis from workflow root `gc.build.code_review_report_path`. If
all required review lanes approve, write a no-op review-fix artifact. If
required fixes or missing evidence remain, make the smallest focused changes
and run proof commands. Write the review-fix artifact under the artifact root
and record it on the workflow root as `gc.build.review_fix_summary_path`.

Set `code_review.verdict=done` only when staff, QA evidence, security, and gap
analysis approve, and update workflow root metadata with
`gc.build.code_review_status=approved`. Set `code_review.verdict=iterate` when
required fixes remain, and update workflow root metadata with
`gc.build.code_review_status=draft`.

Always close with `gc.outcome=pass`,
`code_review.verdict=done|iterate`,
`code_review.report_path=<review-fix artifact path>`, and
`code_review.output_path=<review-fix artifact path>`.

Keep edited build artifacts schema-valid. Stage checks and the build gate's final artifact check validate these
Markdown build artifacts, so any edit you make to one must leave it valid:

- The implementation summary at workflow root metadata `gc.build.implementation_summary_path`, schema `gc.build.implementation-summary.v1`:
  front-matter `status` must be one of `draft`, `approved`, `blocked`, or `superseded`.
- The synthesized review report at workflow root metadata `gc.build.code_review_report_path`, schema `gc.build.review.v1`:
  front-matter `status` must be one of `draft`, `questions`, `approved`, `changes_required`, `blocked`, or `superseded`.

When you edit one of them:

- Edit it in place and preserve its YAML front matter: keep `schema`,
  `workflow`, `methodology`, `producer`, and `trace` intact, and keep
  `trace.coverage` and the Markdown `ID`/`Status` coverage table in sync.
- Use only the allowed `status` values listed above. Do not invent statuses
  such as `reviewed`; record review progress in the apply summary and bead
  metadata, not in the artifact's front matter.
- Before closing with `gc.outcome=pass`, from `$GC_RIG_ROOT`, re-run the
  validator on every build artifact you edited and fix every reported error:
  `python3 .gc/scripts/validate_build_artifact.py --schema gc.build.implementation-summary.v1 --path "<implementation summary path>"`.
  `python3 .gc/scripts/validate_build_artifact.py --schema gc.build.review.v1 --path "<review report path>"`.
- On a repeated attempt (`gc.attempt` greater than 1), first read the validator
  errors from `gc.attempt_log` on the loop control bead and repair the
  artifact in place.

Do not invoke provider-native subagents. This Gas City graph lane is the delegation
mechanism for fixes.
