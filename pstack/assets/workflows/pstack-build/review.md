Use the PStack implementation review expansion on the Gas City graph.

The `pstack-build-review` expansion has already created two review lanes:
acceptance/correctness and gap analysis. Record that this PStack review fanout
is active, then let the expansion own review synthesis, required fixes, and the
final review outcome.

Record the synthesized review report path and pass/fail outcome on the workflow
root bead. Use
`gc bd update "<workflow-root-id>" --set-metadata "gc.build.review_report_path=<absolute path>"`.
Do not use `gc bd update --metadata 'key=value'`; `--metadata` only accepts a JSON
object.
Before closing this step, set the claimed step outcome with
`gc bd update "<claimed-step-id>" --set-metadata "gc.outcome=pass"`, then close
with `gc bd close "<claimed-step-id>" --reason "<concise reason>"`. Do not pass
`--metadata` or `--set-metadata` to `gc bd close`.

Artifact validation: this stage is gated by `.gc/scripts/checks/build-artifact-valid.sh`, which validates the artifact recorded at `gc.build.review_report_path` against schema `gc.build.review.v1`. On repair attempts (`gc.attempt` greater than 1), read the validator errors from `gc.attempt_log` on the validation loop control bead (the dependent of this step bead) and repair the artifact in place instead of rewriting it. Two bounded repair attempts follow the first failure; exhausting them closes this stage with `gc.outcome=fail` and machine-readable validation errors that block downstream stages. Never ask questions in headless mode; record unresolved ambiguity inside the artifact.
